# Edison Take Home Assignment

## Running the application
- Upon opening the project, navigate to the `client` directory & run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- Run `npm start` 

## Additional Information
- Clicking `More Info` will display the height and weight of each pokemon.
- At the bottom of the page is a button to load more pokemon/infinite scroll.

## Further Improvement If I had More Time
Given that the instructions said to plan to spend about 3 hours on this assignment,
there are some things that I would change/fix:
- I'd fix the cards/css to span the width of the page.
- When `More Info` is selected, I'd actually have the modal pop up instead 
    of to the side/underneath.
- I initially started this project with the idea that the API would go through a backend
    express server. I chose to abandon that idea due to alotted time, but further enhancements
    to this project would involve the data being accessed through a backend server.
- I'd also change the `manifest.json` & `index.html` to more accurately represent the topic
    of this project.

## Assignment Reflections
- While I appreciate the flexibility in choosing whichever API that I'd like to work with,
    I found myself being indecisive and spending far too much time choosing an API.
